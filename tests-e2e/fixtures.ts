/**
 * Shared Playwright fixtures for ZET Live E2E tests.
 *
 * Import `test` and `expect` from this file instead of `@playwright/test`
 * directly so app-level fixtures run automatically for every spec.
 *
 * Current fixtures:
 *   - `page` override: injects a localStorage init-script that marks all
 *     onboarding variants as completed, preventing the OnboardingWizard modal
 *     (z-[9999]) from intercepting pointer events during every test.
 *
 * Adding a new fixture later is a one-liner:
 *   export const test = base.extend<{ myFixture: MyType }>({ ... });
 */

   * react-hooks/rules-of-hooks ESLint false positive.
